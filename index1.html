    <h1>What is global warming?</h1>
    <p>
      Global warming is the phenomenon of a gradual increase in the temperature
      near the earthâ€™s surface. This phenomenon has been observed over the past
      one or two centuries. This change has disturbed the climatic pattern of
      the earth. However, the concept of global warming is quite controversial
      but the scientists have provided relevant data in support of the fact that
      the temperature of the earth is rising constantly.
